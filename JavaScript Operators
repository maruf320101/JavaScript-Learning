ðŸ‘‰ Arithmetic Operators
These are used for standard mathematical calculations.
+ (Addition): Adds two numbers.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
/ (Division): Divides one number by another.
% (Modulus): Returns the remainder of a division.
++ (Increment): Increases a number by one.
-- (Decrement): Decreases a number by one.

ðŸ‘‰ Assignment Operators =
These operators are used to assign values to variables.
= (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+= (Add and assign): Adds the right value to the left variable and assigns the result. (e.g., a += b is the same as a = a + b).
-= (Subtract and assign): a -= b is the same as a = a - b.
*= (Multiply and assign): a *= b is the same as a = a * b.
/= (Divide and assign): a /= b is the same as a = a / b.

ðŸ‘‰ Comparison Operators
These are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
== (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal, but converts types if they are different.
=== (Strict equal to): Checks if two values are equal and if they are of the same type. (This is generally the recommended method).
!= (Not equal to): The opposite of ==.
!== (Strict not equal to): The opposite of ===.
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)

ðŸ‘‰ Logical Operators
These are used to combine multiple boolean conditions.
&& (AND): Returns true only if both conditions are true.
|| (OR): Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.
! (NOT): Inverts a boolean value (true becomes false, false becomes true).

ðŸ‘‰ String Operator 
The + operator can also be used to join (concatenate) strings. If one of the operands is a string, the other will also be converted to a string.

ðŸ‘‰ Ternary Operator
This is a shortcut for a simple if-else statement.
Syntax: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
